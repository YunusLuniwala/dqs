Diet Quality Score is a simple, practical scoring system described in 
the book "Racing Weight" by Matt Fitzgerald. 

This is an app to calculate DQS for each day. Here's how to use it:

 * Read the book
 * Install this app on your under-used Android tablet
 * Tap food items as you eat them, or all at once at the end of day
 * Once a while write the scores down on paper, as this app will *eat your data*

Happy eating!
